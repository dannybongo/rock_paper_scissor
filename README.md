# rock_paper_scissor

Welcome to my first JavaScript project; a name of Rock, Paper, Scissors. You've likely seen many people code this for a first project, so whilst I won't get marks for orginality, the project does serve as a good starting point for putting my JavaScript skills into action.

**Skills learnt/Understood**

Using QuerySelectors and GetElement to interact with the DOM and build an interactive web page.
Developed my understanding of calling functions within functions.
Using Math.Random to generate numbers - I feel this is a function that will come alot in the future.
Developed my understanding of statements

**Lessons Learnt**

Struggled for a while trying to call the return values of functions. This is where I learnt that you can call functions within other functions. You need to assign the function a variable to get the return value.

Originally, we had 3 query selectors and 3 event listeners. I was having trouble working out how return the desired value depending on what button the user clicks. In the end, I decided to go for one event listener and one query selector to encapsulate all the buttons. From there, it was easy to assign the users input to a variable

The script is better at the bottom of the HTML because if ran before a certain element exists, the script will throw up errors.

If having an issue with not being able to select a certain element, try a different '.getelement' method.
