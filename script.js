// General comments 

// Had an absolute nightmare trying to get the return values from playerChoice and computerChoice to work in the function playRound. The outputs were fine within the functions, but I was trying to call up variables inside playRound containing the player and computer choices. If I console logged those variables inside playRound, I got 'undefined'.

// What I needed to do was assign the function's I needed variables inside the playRound function. When playRound runs, the other functions are run and their outputs are assigned to their respective variables.

//learn about arrow functions.

//the script is better at the bottom of the HTML because if ran before a certain element exists, the script will throw up errors.

//          <button class="player-options rock" data-button="rock">‚úä</button> added this to the HTML, gave me a way to use use an assigned value to the button

//if having an issue with not being able to select a certain element, try a different '.getelement' method

//Originally, we had 3 query selectors and 3 event listeners. I was having trouble working out how return the desired value depending on what button the user clicks. In the end, I decided to go for one event listener and one query selector to encapsulate all the buttons. From there, it was easy to assign the users input to a variable
